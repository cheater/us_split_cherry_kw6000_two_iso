* use evdev.extras.xml instead of evdev.xml. See if that works at all.
* check this for more options for the console: http://web.archive.org/web/20100413120621/http://www.jw-stumpel.nl/stestu.html

* try to use redirects for the level 3 arrow keys to fix things like pluma (gedit) not selecting text on shift+ISO_Level_3_Shift+hjkl.
In theory, this should work:
    key <AC08> {
	type[Group1]="THREE_LEVEL_SHIFTABLE",
	symbols[Group1]=[	h, H, Left, Left	],
	actions[Group1]=[ NoAction(), NoAction(), RedirectKey(key=<LEFT>), RedirectKey(key=<LEFT>, modifiers=Shift) ] };

but instead it makes the key not work at all when ISO_Level3_Shift is used.
* try to use redirects somehow to make dict.leo.org stop receiving altgr (which is the same thing as ISO_Level3_Shift). Or perhaps just use another key for the modifier? Hyper? ISO Level 5?
* fix the installer to add the types to types/basic.
